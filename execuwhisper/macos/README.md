<p align="center"><strong>ExecuWhisper is your free, open-source alternative to Wispr Flow and SuperWhisper.</strong></p>

If you don't want to pay $12–$15/month for Wispr Flow or SuperWhisper but want the core flow — press a hotkey, dictate, get clean punctuated text pasted into the focused app — ExecuWhisper does just that, **fully on-device**: NVIDIA Parakeet-TDT for ASR (Metal) + a fine-tuned LiquidAI LFM2.5-350M for cleanup (MLX), running on [ExecuTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch). No cloud, no API keys, no telemetry; the only network call is the first-launch model download from Hugging Face Hub.

**100% free** for personal and commercial use under BSD-3-Clause. Wispr Flow / SuperWhisper are great products and this is not a 1:1 clone — if you need cloud sync, team collab, or agentic "rules," support those teams. If you want something free, open, and that keeps your voice on your laptop, this is for you.

> **Status:** v0.1.0 — Apple Silicon, macOS 14+. Three required ExecuTorch helper PRs are still in upstream review (see [Build From Source](#build-from-source)); prebuilt arm64 helpers are attached to the [GitHub Release](#install-prebuilt) so you don't have to build them yourself.

## Demo

### In-app dictation

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0557b3d-fd2e-4c8d-9ca1-dd9a35f6736c

**What you hear in the clip:**

> _"Uh can we, can we move the meeting uh to Friday, actually no, let's let's make it Monday at 10 in the morning."_

**What gets pasted:**

> Can we move the meeting to Friday? Actually, no, let's make it Monday at 10 AM in the morning.

### System-wide overlay dictation

Press the global hotkey (`Ctrl+Space` by default) in any app — Notes, Slack, browser, IDE — and a floating overlay captures speech, then auto-pastes the formatted text into the focused text field.

(Recording outline lives in [`docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md).)

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/architecture.png" alt="ExecuWhisper architecture diagram" />
</p>

At a glance: microphone → `AudioRecorder` → `parakeet_helper` (Metal, [pytorch/executorch#18861](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/18861)) → 30-word chunker → `lfm25_formatter_helper` (MLX, [pytorch/executorch#19562](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/19562); export from [#19195](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/19195)) → validator + replacements → `ExecuWhisper Paste Helper` (`LSBackgroundOnly`; CGEvent ⌘V) → focused text field in any app.

## Footprint & Performance

| What | Value |
|---|---:|
| LFM2.5 formatter throughput (mean over 100-row AMI eval) | **533 tok/s** |

Throughput numbers from `eval/eval_ami_mlx_4w_g32.json` on the [formatter HF repo](https://huggingface.co/younghan-meta/LFM2.5-350M-ExecuWhisper-Formatter).

## Features

- **Fully on-device** — no cloud, no API keys, no telemetry. The only network traffic is the first-launch model download from the Hugging Face Hub.
- **System-wide dictation** — press `Ctrl+Space` (configurable) in any app; a floating overlay shows the live capture. Final text is auto-pasted into the focused text field.
- **Smart reformatting** — the LFM2.5-350M formatter cleans up disfluencies, restores casing/punctuation, and infers list structure. Trained specifically to refuse to "answer" the dictation, even when the user's voice ends in a question.
- **Long input chunking** — transcripts longer than ~30 words are formatted in chunks; the validator falls back to raw text on any chunk the model garbles, so you never lose words.
- **Replacements & snippets** — auto-correct names/acronyms; trigger templates with a phrase.
- **Searchable session history** — rename, pin, group by recency. Export to `.txt`, `.json`, `.srt`.
- **Open helpers** — `parakeet_helper` and `lfm25_formatter_helper` speak a tiny JSON-line protocol over stdin/stdout. Easy to script with the included `scripts/probe_formatter.py`.

## Install (prebuilt path)

For users who want to skip building three upstream ExecuTorch PRs:

1. Download the prebuilt helpers tarball from the [v0.1.0 GitHub Release](https://github.com/seyeong-han/executorch-examples/releases/tag/execuwhisper-v0.1.0) (`helpers-arm64-darwin.tar.gz`).
2. Extract into your ExecuTorch checkout:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/executorch/cmake-out/examples/models/llama
   mkdir -p ~/executorch/cmake-out/examples/models/parakeet
   tar -xzf helpers-arm64-darwin.tar.gz -C ~/executorch/cmake-out/examples/models/
   ```
3. Install libomp (LLVM OpenMP runtime — not redistributed in the release):
   ```bash
   brew install libomp
   ```
4. Set your Apple Developer team and build:
   ```bash
   brew install xcodegen
   cd execuwhisper/macos
   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=YOUR_TEAM_ID xcodegen generate
   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=YOUR_TEAM_ID ./scripts/build.sh
   ```

The prebuilt helpers are ad-hoc-signed, so first launch will trigger a Gatekeeper warning. Right-click the `.app` → **Open**, or run:
```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ExecuWhisper.app
```

> **Note on entitlements.** The helpers ship pre-signed with the hardened runtime + `disable-library-validation` + `allow-dyld-environment-variables` entitlements. If you re-sign them yourself, preserve those entitlements (see `scripts/sign_release.sh`) so the helpers can load `libomp.dylib` from `/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp`.

## Build From Source

For users who want everything compiled from source.

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma or newer)
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Xcode 16+
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- An Apple Developer team identifier (free or paid). Set it via the `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` environment variable; the project does **not** hard-code one.

```bash
brew install xcodegen libomp
```

### Upstream ExecuTorch PRs

Two of the three helper PRs against `pytorch/executorch` have landed on `main`; the formatter helper is still in review. Build against a recent `main` checkout (which already includes the merged PRs) and add the one remaining PR:

| PR | What it adds | Where it lands | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [pytorch/executorch#18861](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/18861) | `parakeet_helper` (ASR runtime, Metal) + `make parakeet-metal` | `cmake-out/examples/models/parakeet/parakeet_helper` | Merged |
| [pytorch/executorch#19195](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/19195) | LFM2.5 MLX export pipeline + `lfm2_5_350m` model class + `lfm_2_5-mlx` Makefile target | export-time only | Merged |
| [pytorch/executorch#19562](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/19562) | `lfm25_formatter_helper` (formatter runtime, MLX) + `make lfm_2_5_formatter-mlx` | `cmake-out/examples/models/llama/lfm25_formatter_helper` | In review |

Check out the remaining PR before building:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/executorch ~/executorch
cd ~/executorch
gh pr checkout 19562 -b lfm25-helper
# Resolve any conflicts manually if the branch doesn't merge cleanly onto main.
```

If `gh pr checkout` is unavailable, the equivalent is `git fetch origin pull/19562/head:lfm25-helper` followed by a merge or cherry-pick.

### 1. Set up the conda environments

The Parakeet helper builds in `et-metal`; the LFM2.5 formatter helper builds in `et-mlx`. Two separate envs are needed because the MLX runtime ships its own pinned `numpy` / `torch` that conflicts with the Metal backend's deps.

```bash
conda create -n et-metal python=3.12 -y
conda activate et-metal
pip install -r scripts/requirements_et-metal.txt
pip install -e ~/executorch  # editable install of the local checkout

conda create -n et-mlx python=3.12 -y
conda activate et-mlx
pip install -r scripts/requirements_et-mlx.txt
pip install -e ~/executorch
```

The `requirements_*.txt` files are exact pin captures from a known-good Mac. Treat them as a starting point — you may need to relax pins if upstream packages move.

### 2. Build the Parakeet helper (Metal)

```bash
cd ~/executorch
conda activate et-metal
make parakeet-metal
```

Produces `~/executorch/cmake-out/examples/models/parakeet/parakeet_helper`.

### 3. Build the LFM2.5 formatter helper (MLX)

```bash
cd ~/executorch
conda activate et-mlx
make lfm_2_5_formatter-mlx
```

Produces `~/executorch/cmake-out/examples/models/llama/lfm25_formatter_helper` and `~/executorch/cmake-out/examples/models/llama/mlx.metallib`.

### 4. Build the macOS app

```bash
cd execuwhisper/macos
brew install xcodegen
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=YOUR_TEAM_ID xcodegen generate
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=YOUR_TEAM_ID ./scripts/build.sh
```

Produces `./build/Build/Products/Release/ExecuWhisper.app`.

The post-compile script copies `parakeet_helper`, `lfm25_formatter_helper`, `mlx.metallib`, and `libomp.dylib` into `Contents/Resources/`. To embed the model artifacts into the bundle (otherwise downloaded on first launch):

```bash
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=YOUR_TEAM_ID ./scripts/build.sh --download-models --bundle-models
```

If your `~/executorch` checkout lives elsewhere, override paths via env:

```bash
export EXECUTORCH_PATH="$HOME/path/to/executorch"
export PARAKEET_HELPER_PATH="$EXECUTORCH_PATH/cmake-out/examples/models/parakeet/parakeet_helper"
export FORMATTER_HELPER_PATH="$EXECUTORCH_PATH/cmake-out/examples/models/llama/lfm25_formatter_helper"
export FORMATTER_METALLIB_PATH="$EXECUTORCH_PATH/cmake-out/examples/models/llama/mlx.metallib"
```

## Run

On first launch, ExecuWhisper downloads ~1.3 GB of model artifacts:

| File | Source | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `model.pte` | [`younghan-meta/Parakeet-TDT-ExecuTorch-Metal`](https://huggingface.co/younghan-meta/Parakeet-TDT-ExecuTorch-Metal) | ~822 MB |
| `tokenizer.model` | same | ~360 KB |
| `lfm2_5_350m_mlx_4w.pte` | [`younghan-meta/LFM2.5-350M-ExecuWhisper-Formatter`](https://huggingface.co/younghan-meta/LFM2.5-350M-ExecuWhisper-Formatter) | ~468 MB |
| `tokenizer.json` | same | ~4.5 MB |
| `tokenizer_config.json` | same | <1 KB |

Files land in `~/Library/Application Support/ExecuWhisper/models/`. Re-download by deleting that directory.

Grant permissions when prompted:

- **Microphone** — for `ExecuWhisper.app` (audio capture).
- **Accessibility** — for `ExecuWhisper Paste Helper.app` (so it can simulate `Cmd+V` into other apps). The helper is installed under `Contents/Resources/`; macOS treats it as its own bundle for permission purposes.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd+Shift+R` | Start recording / stop and transcribe |
| `Cmd+Shift+C` | Copy the current transcript |
| `Ctrl+Space` | Toggle system-wide dictation overlay (configurable in Settings) |

### Run tests

```bash
cd execuwhisper/macos
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=YOUR_TEAM_ID xcodegen generate
xcodebuild \
  -project ExecuWhisper.xcodeproj \
  -scheme ExecuWhisper \
  -derivedDataPath build \
  -destination "platform=macOS" \
  test
```

## Models

| Repo | Purpose | Base model |
|---|---|---|
| [`younghan-meta/Parakeet-TDT-ExecuTorch-Metal`](https://huggingface.co/younghan-meta/Parakeet-TDT-ExecuTorch-Metal) | ASR runtime artifacts (Metal-quantized `.pte`) | [`nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2) |
| [`younghan-meta/LFM2.5-350M-ExecuWhisper-Formatter`](https://huggingface.co/younghan-meta/LFM2.5-350M-ExecuWhisper-Formatter) | Formatter runtime artifacts (MLX-quantized `.pte`) + fp32 fine-tune + tokenizer + eval results | [`LiquidAI/LFM2.5-350M`](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2.5-350M) |

The formatter model card includes a Python `Quick Start` for using the `.pte` outside the app, AMI eval numbers (forbidden 0.030 / coverage 0.874), and a re-export guide for users who want to swap in a different quantization.

### Fine-tune your own formatter

To retrain or adapt the formatter to a new domain (e.g. medical, legal, multilingual dictation), follow the **[Unsloth LFM2.5 fine-tuning tutorial](https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/tutorials/lfm2.5)**. The tutorial covers SFT + LoRA, hyperparameter selection, and export to GGUF/MLX. After training, use the `lfm_2_5-mlx` export pipeline ([pytorch/executorch#19195](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/pull/19195)) to produce a `.pte` that drops into ExecuWhisper.

## Status & Known Issues

- macOS-only; no iOS/Linux/Windows app yet.
- Two of the three upstream ExecuTorch PRs (#18861, #19195) have landed on `main`; the formatter helper (#19562) is still in review. Until it lands, follow the [Build From Source](#build-from-source) workflow or use the prebuilt helpers from the GitHub Release.
- The formatter occasionally over-summarizes self-corrections ("actually, no — make it tomorrow") and may drop the closing name in email-style sign-offs. See the model card for full eval numbers and limitations.
- Long inputs are chunked at a 30-word boundary on word splits; very short follow-up clauses can land in their own chunk and get capitalized as if starting a new sentence. A smarter chunker is on the follow-up list.
- No telemetry. The app makes one network call: first-launch model download from `huggingface.co`. After that, all inference is local.
